# CS2 Kernel

A basic driver that can read and write the memory of a target process at the kernel level without using Windows API.

## How to use:
    Disable the antivirus software.
    Load the KernelMode.sys file into the kernel.
    Launch the game.
    Start UserMode.exe.

You can use [kdmapper](https://github.com/TheCruZ/kdmapper) to load sys file.

Utilizing kernel-level privileges can bypass many user-mode anti-cheat (e.g., VAC).
